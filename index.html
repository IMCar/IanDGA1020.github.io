            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Ian Mark Caruana ,  38 years old with great interest in sound especially natural organic soundscapes.  
                A passion for science communication started since I got employed at Esplora Interactive Science Centre, Malta about 5 years ago.  Last year I have won the Star Awards  final as most nominated employee amongst the museums in Malta.

                Lately I learnt that I am a cat person and big cat lover after saving 2 very young kittens (Marsh and Mellow) which lost their mum and were dehydrated due to a construction site that closed the access to their hiding place.
            </p>

            <p>
                I consider myself having a very playful personality which shows best whilst hosting school visits at work and interacting with big groups inside the planetarium.
                Since Covid-19 has driven most education Online I felt the need to get my IT knowledge up to date with regards E-learning platforms and methodology.
                A short video titled Space Radio  gives an idea of what I love doing most apart from chilling in nature playing instruments or recording organic sounds.  Both music and video are self produced.  Planetarium software was used to compose the images.  Enjoy!
