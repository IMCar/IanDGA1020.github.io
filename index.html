                <h4>Biography</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My name is Ian Mark Caruana , 39 years old with great interest in sound design especially natural
                    organic soundscapes.
                    A passion for Digital Arts sparked since I felt the need to colour my compositions with a visual
                    narrative.
                    Whilst producing music and soundscapes my mind starts to create pictures and sometimes I can also
                    visualize a story
                    which takes over my composition driving the sounds being produced. In 2021 I decide
                    to join the <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/maks/digitalarts">Department of Digital Arts at the
                        University of Malta</a> which has been an exceptional learning experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sound design is the art of giving aural texture to visuals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Music and sound production was once considered as a post visual process. This is a normal proceedure
                    in the production of traditional filming. The sound design process is nowadays being initiated by
                    many production
                    companies at concept phase especially in the creation of animation and games.

                    Sound and music is like a binding agent which moulds the visuals. Sound may alter the viewers
                    understanding of the visual
                    dynamics
                    in a scene. If your hear the sound of glass shattering, what
                    does this
                    trigger in your thoughts? The breaking sound could have many direct relations to the breaking of an
                    actual object
                    made of glass but it can also trigger an emotional condition that something irreversable has
                    happened such as the end of a
                    relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I personally think of sound and music to be a complete phenomena because one can visualize his own
                    creative
                    story in his imagination. Visuals on their own effect our reasoning of happenings but visuals with
                    sound,
                    effect our senses deeper giving more weight, volume and dynamics to a scene. Imagine you are
                    watching a clip of a gunshot
                    or a bomb exploding or else a high speed car crash without sound. Adding sound to the 3 examples
                    will add understanding such as
                    the type of gun being used, the severity and dimensions of the explosion, the speed and severity
                    of the impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I am working with various visual design tools and experiencing a well-structured tuition
                    by experts
                    in the field. My main interest is in the production of moving graphics such as film, animation and
                    3d.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The projects presented underneath are a selection of completed assignments using various design
                    tools
                    The techniques used to achieve the results
                    were primarily
                    researched and later applied. In some of the projects more than one software and technique was
                    used in order
                    to learn how the practices interect together.

                <p>
                    The fruit and bowl in this animation were created by using the Scupting tool in
                    <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. The most difficult part of this excercise
                    was to give texture to different fruit especially the strawbery. Different techniques were used
                    in the same software to achieve a realistic result resembling a sculpture. Adding different levels
                    of white light and varying positions and intesity of the light created shadows and reflections
                    outlining the
                    different shapes and positioning.

                    <p>
                        The creative approach taken towards this project was to experiment with light, transparent
                        objects and colours in a still life
                        videography experience. The fruit were used for their vibrant colours and shapes thus helping in
                        creating depth
                        in the set whilst wine glasses were used to create reflections and visual effects. As the name
                        defines their is a pendulum which
                        seems floating from one side to the other expressing tha notion of movement and time. Without
                        the pendulum and another moving object in the end of the video
                        the filming could have been a single photograph. The process and text were edited in

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Pixel art is famous for its use in games and the idea behind this kind of art is to create
                        charaters
                        that need not be close to real. You do not need to be an experienced artist to create your own
                        character and
                        I chose to create an Earth Worm as test ground to be used in <a
                            href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> game engine.
                        The earth worm is seen performing the Idle, Walk, Jump, Run, Fall and Dying sequences used in
                        most 2d platform games.
                        <a
                            href="https://www.google.com/search?q=piskel&rlz=1C1GCEA_enMT993MT993&oq=Peskel&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i10i59j0i10i512j0i512j0i10l6.3489j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Piskel</a>
                        is a very simple online application were one can create his own Pixel art and extract the image
                        sequences called sprites to be used in game engines or animation software.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to explore the possibilities of using Photogrometry software such as
                        <a href="https://www.3dflow.net/3df-zephyr-photogrammetry-software/">3DF Zephyr</a>
                        to capture a 3D scan of an object. Photogrometry is the process of creating a 3D drawing
                        of an object in software by using photos taken from diffenet angles. For this project 55 photos
                        were taken.
                        The sofware will than do complex calculations from the photos uploaded and renders a 3
                        dimentional image as a result.
                        The software creates a 3D mesh model of the object that can later be processed in other 3D
                        software such as <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>.
                        A pedestal and flooring were added to the animation to give more dynamics to the rotating
                        object.
