                <h4>Biography</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My name is Ian Mark Caruana , 39 years old with great interest in sound design especially natural
                    organic soundscapes.
                    A passion for Digital Arts sparked since I felt the need to colour my compositions with a visual
                    narrative.
                    Whilst producing music and soundscapes my mind starts to create pictures and sometimes I can also
                    visualize a story
                    which takes over my composition driving the sounds being produced. In 2021 I decide
                    to join the <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/maks/digitalarts">Department of Digital Arts at the
                        University of Malta</a> which has been an exceptional learning experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sound design is the art of giving aural texture to visuals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Music and sound production was once considered as a post visual process. This is a normal proceedure
                    in the production of traditional filming. The sound design process is now adays being initiated by
                    many production
                    companies at concept phase especially in the creation of animation and games.

                    Sound and music is like a binding agent which moulds the visuals. Sound may alter the viewers
                    understanding of the visual
                    dynamics
                    in a scene. If your hear the sound of glass shattering, what
                    does this
                    trigger in your thoughts? The breaking sound could have many direct relations to the breaking of an
                    actual object
                    made of glass but it can also trigger an emotional condition that something irriversable has
                    happened such as the end of a
                    relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I personally think of sound and music to be a complete phenomena because one can visualize his own
                    creative
                    story in his immagination. Visuals on their own effect our reseoning of heppennings but visuals with
                    sound,
                    effect our senses deeper giving more weight, volume and dynamics to a scene. Imagine you are
                    watching a clip of a gunshot
                    or a bomb exploding or else a high speed car crash without sound. Adding sound to the 3 examples
                    will add and understanding
                    of the type of gun being used, the severity and dimensions of the explotion, the speed and severity
                    of the ipact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I am working with various visual design tools and experiencing a well structured tuition
                    by experts
                    in the field. My main interest is in the production of moving graphics such as film, animation and
                    3d.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The projects presented underneath are a selection of completed assignments using various design
                    tools
                    ranging from illustation to 3d modelling and animation. The technics used to achieve the results
                    were primarily
                    researched and later applied. In some of the projects more than one software and technique was
                    used in order
                    to learn how the practices interect together.
